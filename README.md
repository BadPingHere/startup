# startup
This is my personal startup script, which opens my appications, adds my firefox tabs, and types in my password into KeePassXC.

# Instalation
1. Download the python script.
2. Install [pywinauto](https://github.com/pywinauto/pywinauto). This can be done easily with ```pip install -U pywinauto```. If this doesnt work, I reccomend following their instalation [here](https://pywinauto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#manual-installation).

Optional: Add the script to your autorun.
