# Startup

This is my personal startup script, which opens my appications, adds my firefox tabs, and types my password into KeePassXC.

# Instalation

### Python:

1. Download the python script.
2. Download Python. I use 3.9.2, But this likely works with all 3.x.x python versions.
3. Install [pywinauto](https://github.com/pywinauto/pywinauto). This can be done easily with `pip install -U pywinauto`. If this doesnt work, I reccomend following their instalation [here](https://pywinauto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#manual-installation).

### Python:

1. Download the rust folder.
2. Download rust.
3. Build the exe, and edit parameters on the main.rs file.
4. Run.
